### Network Representation

Networks are represented in a node-edge format:
- Nodes include identifiers and weights
- Edges include source, target, and weight information
- Summary statistics provide quick insights into structure

## Why We Built This

### Human-Readable + Machine-Readable

Traditional EDA outputs are designed for human interpretation through visualizations and statistical summaries. However, to fully leverage the power of LLMs in understanding our dataset, we needed a way to translate these insights into a structured format that LLMs can easily process and reason with.

### Comprehensive Understanding

The LLM-interpretable EDA framework ensures that LLMs can gain a complete understanding of:
- Dataset structure and composition
- Feature distributions and relationships
- Temporal patterns
- Text characteristics
- Sentiment patterns
- Network structures and relationships

### Enabling LLM-Assisted Analysis

By providing structured, comprehensive data summaries to LLMs, we enable them to:
1. Synthesize complex patterns across multiple dimensions
2. Identify anomalies and interesting correlations
3. Generate insights that might be missed in traditional visual analysis
4. Assist in feature engineering and selection

## How It Works

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from processed CSV files
2. **Basic Analysis**: Statistical summaries and distributions are calculated
3. **Feature Analysis**: Categorical, numerical, and temporal features are analyzed
4. **NLP Processing**: Text features are extracted and analyzed
5. **Network Analysis**: Hashtag and mention networks are constructed
6. **LLM Context Generation**: All analyses are compiled into structured JSON
7. **Insight Extraction**: Key patterns, anomalies, and relationships are identified

### LLM-Interpretable Output Format

The framework generates two main JSON files:

1. **llm_eda_context.json**: A comprehensive dataset summary containing:
   - Dataset overview (shape, types, missing values)
   - Categorical feature analysis (distributions, unique values)
   - Numerical feature analysis (statistics, distributions, correlations)
   - Temporal pattern analysis (hourly/daily distributions, peak times)
   - NLP feature analysis (text characteristics, hashtag usage)
   - Sentiment analysis (distributions, patterns by category/region)
   - Network analysis (hashtag/mention networks, key nodes)

2. **llm_eda_context_insights.json**: Extracted key insights including:
   - Dominant patterns in the data
   - Anomalies and outliers
   - Strong correlations
   - Imbalanced distributions
   - Network characteristics

### Network Analysis Approach

The network analysis module constructs and analyzes two types of networks:

1. **Hashtag Co-occurrence Network**:
   - Nodes represent hashtags
   - Edges represent co-occurrence in the same tweet
   - Weight reflects frequency of co-occurrence
   
2. **Mention Network**:
   - Nodes represent mentioned accounts
   - Edges represent co-mention in the same tweet
   - Weight reflects frequency of co-mention

Both networks are analyzed for:
- Size (number of nodes/edges)
- Density (proportion of potential connections that exist)
- Central nodes (most frequently occurring)
- Connection patterns
