# EDA Charts & Visualizations Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the troll tweets dataset, including the visualization techniques used, their purpose, and alternatives.

## Overview

The EDA pipeline analyzes the troll tweets dataset from multiple perspectives, using various visualization techniques to uncover patterns and insights. The analysis is structured into different modules to facilitate understanding:

```
main.py               # Main EDA execution script
eda_basic.py          # Basic statistics and feature analysis
eda_nlp.py            # Natural language processing analysis
eda_network.py        # Network structure analysis
eda_llm.py            # LLM-compatible structured EDA outputs
eda_helpers.py        # Helper functions for EDA tasks
```

## Basic Statistics

### What is Used
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Missing value counts
- Data type information
- CSV exports of descriptive statistics

### Why It's Used
- Provides foundational understanding of the dataset

### Why It's Used
- Identifies connected campaigns and themes
- Reveals coordination between accounts
- Maps influence and information flow
- Detects communities and clusters

## LLM-Compatible EDA

### What is Used
- JSON-structured EDA results
- Comprehensive data summaries
- Insight generation
- LLM context preparation

### Why It's Used
- Enables AI-assisted interpretation of EDA results
