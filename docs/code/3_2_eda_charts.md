## Overview

The EDA pipeline analyzes the troll tweets dataset from multiple perspectives, using various visualization techniques to uncover patterns and insights. The analysis is structured into different modules to facilitate understanding:

```
main.py               # Main EDA execution script
eda_basic.py          # Basic statistics and feature analysis
eda_nlp.py            # Natural language processing analysis
eda_network.py        # Network structure analysis
eda_llm.py            # LLM-compatible structured EDA outputs
eda_helpers.py        # Helper functions for EDA tasks
```
